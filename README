Sinatrails is sinatra bootstrap project that suit to my needs to create web application with Rails-like directory structure and Active Record as ORM.

To use this project:
1. git clone git://github.com/kuntoaji/sinatrails.git
2. bundle install
3. run rake db:migrate to create user. Note: Currently only support db:migrate for migration, so create your database first if you use mysql.
4. run ./scripts/test to run test units.
5. ./scripts/server -s thin to execute the thin server or ./scripts/console to the console.
